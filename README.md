1. What is Sudoku Game Play?

Sudoku or originally called "Number Place" is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", "regions", or "subsquares") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.

2. About sudoku app

This is a Web Service that generates a fixed board. The webservice runs on port 8080. In the future, difficulty and size will be developed for the random game board. 

3. How to run the application
    
git clone https://github.com/gleisoncs/sudoku
    
mvn clean package
	
java -jar target/Sudoku-1.0.jar

or
	
java -jar target/Sudoku-1.0.jar -Dserver.port=8090 (optional param for specify a diferent port)

4. How to use

To generate a sudoku board (fixed board) with GET request

http://<server>:<port>/getboard/<difficulty>/<size>

Params:
- difficulty : how effort will you dedicated to solve the problem
- size       : how many movements the operator wants
        
This returns an Object with the following attributes 
- id         : unique long id associated with the board   
- size       : the size of sudoku passed by param when it was created first time (not used yet, prepared to the future)
- difficulty : the dificulty of board (not used yet, prepared to the future)
- board      : Sudoku board (fixed board so far)
                   
Example      : http://localhost:8080/getboard/1/9
     
Output: {"id":100001,"size":9,"difficultyLevel":1,"board":[[0,9,1,1,4,6,5,3,8],[4,6,5,6,3,8,7,1,9],[3,1,8,5,7,9,6,4,2],[5,3,9,8,6,4,2,7,1],[2,7,6,9,1,3,4,8,5],[8,4,1,7,2,5,9,6,3],[9,5,7,4,8,1,3,2,6],[1,2,3,6,5,7,8,9,4],[6,8,4,3,9,2,1,5,7]]}
                
5. To make a move on a PREVIOUS Sudoku Board issue a PUT request on
            
http://<server>:<port>/validatemove?id=<id>&x=<coordinateX>&y=<coordinateY>&number=<number generated by user>

Params:
- id         : specific existing board passed by operator
- coordinateX: coordinates X based on cartesian coordinates
- coordinateY: coordinates Y based on cartesian coordinates
- number     : number insert initially by the user that is playing the game

This returns a the following attributes 
- VALID      : if the move is valid
- INVALID    : if the move is invalid
- COMPLETE   : if the board is completed
- Exception  : if the board didn't encountered id or id is invalid
                   
Example      : http://localhost:8080/validatemove/100001/0/1/9
    
Output       : VALID

5.1. Create RandomBoard and FixedBoard with difficulty and size (applying SOLID OCP)
5.2. Security
5.3. Time-out
5.4. DELETE method (for rollback movement)
